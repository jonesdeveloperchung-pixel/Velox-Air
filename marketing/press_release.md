**PixelMirror Studio Announces Velox Air: The Eco-Friendly Way to Reclaim Your Legacy Tech**

**[City, Date]** – PixelMirror Studio is proud to announce the release of **Velox Air (v1.0)**, a revolutionary software solution designed to give new life to aging tablets and smartphones. By transforming legacy devices into efficient, passive auxiliary displays, Velox Air offers a sustainable and practical solution for developers, creators, and eco-conscious users.

In a world where technology becomes obsolete faster than ever, millions of perfectly functional tablets sit gathering dust in drawers. Velox Air ends this cycle. Unlike traditional screen mirroring apps that require powerful hardware and drain battery life, Velox Air is built specifically for older devices.

**"The most sustainable monitor is the one you already own,"** says the Lead Developer at PixelMirror Studio. "We built Velox Air to be 'The Companion'—a set-and-forget display for your documentation, logs, or music, running on hardware you thought was retired."

**Key Features:**
*   **Zero-Install Client:** No app store required. Works directly through any modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge).
*   **Eco-Mode (20 FPS):** intelligently caps frame rates to prevent battery drain and overheating, ensuring devices run cool for hours.
*   **Resilient Architecture:** Features auto-reconnect, strict privacy compliance, and a fault-tolerant design that keeps the stream alive even on unstable Wi-Fi.
*   **Cross-Platform Host:** The lightweight server runs seamlessly on Windows, broadcasting to any iOS or Android device.

**Availability:**
Velox Air v1.0 is available now as a standalone executable. It is part of the Velox Studio portfolio, sitting alongside the high-performance "Warp" and professional "Flow" tiers.
