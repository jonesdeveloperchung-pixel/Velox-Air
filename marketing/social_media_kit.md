**Headline: Sustainability meets Productivity in our latest release.**

We are excited to launch **Velox Air v1.0**. 

In the software development lifecycle, we often need just "one more screen" for passive information—server logs, documentation, or team chats. Instead of buying new hardware, Velox Air empowers you to reclaim the legacy tablets and phones already in your office.

Built with a unique "Eco-Mode" architecture, it prioritizes thermal management and battery life over raw frame rate, making it perfect for devices that would otherwise struggle with modern apps.

Try the standalone build today and upgrade your workspace sustainably.
