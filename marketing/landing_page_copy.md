## [Value Proposition]

### ♻️ The "Upcycler" for Your Desk
You have an old iPad or Android tablet in a drawer. It's too slow for games, but perfect for Velox Air. We turn it into a wireless auxiliary monitor designed specifically for static content like **API Docs**, **Spotify**, **Slack**, or **Terminal Logs**.

### 🔋 Battery First Architecture
Most screen extenders burn through battery in 45 minutes. Velox Air uses a specialized **Adaptive Eco-Governor**:
*   **20 FPS Lock:** Smooth enough for reading, gentle on the CPU.
*   **Super Eco Mode:** Automatically drops to 10 FPS if your battery hits 20%.
*   **Thermal Protection:** Keeps your old device cool to the touch.

### 🔗 Zero Friction
*   **No App Store:** Just open Chrome or Safari.
*   **No Accounts:** Direct P2P connection over your Wi-Fi.
*   **No Config:** Auto-discovery finds your PC instantly.
